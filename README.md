# Front-end Assessment Starter Project

This will watch for changes to the HTML and Sass files, and automatically recompile the sass and refresh the browser.

## Initial installation

```
npm install
```

## To run

```
npm start
```

## HTML
**index.html** in the root folder is the file that is displayed in the browser

## Sass
Source file(s) should be placed in **src/scss**. **styles.scss** is the primary sass file that gets compiled and included in **index.html**

*This framework is based on a [starter framework](https://github.com/mbarker84/project-starter) by Michelle Barker*
